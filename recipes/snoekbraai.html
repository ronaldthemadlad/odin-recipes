        <p>This dish is one that is great for a cool summer evening. It's one that is great for winding down on a Friday after a long week, or even something to enjoy with your friends during a weekend get-together! Snoek is a type of fish typically caught around the Western Cape coastal areas. Although it is rather boney, the flavour is unbeatable and I find it to be rather refreshing, especially with a dash of lemon !!</p>
