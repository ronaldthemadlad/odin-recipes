        <p>This dish is one that is great for a cool summer evening. It's one that is great for winding down on a Friday after a long week, or even something to enjoy with your friends during a weekend get-together! Snoek is a type of fish typically caught around the Western Cape coastal areas. Although it is rather boney, the flavour is unbeatable and I find it to be rather refreshing, especially with a dash of lemon !!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 Medium Sized Fresh Snoek</li>
                <li>3 Tablespoons Butter</li>
                <li>3 Tablespoons Apricot Jam</li>
                <li>1/2 Fresh Lemon<li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Ground Pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Method:</h3>

            <ol>

                <li>Ensure the snoek is cleaned and gutted so that it can easily fold open.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter.</li>
                <li>Evenly spread the butter over the fish so that it can absorb into the fish.</li>
                <li>Melt the jam until fully liquid and gently smear the jam on top of the butter, over the fish.</li>
                <li>Gently squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top of the butter and jam, ensuring small droplets are spread evenly.</li>
                <li>Place the fish in tin foil and ensure the fish is fully covered on both sides.</li>
                <li>Allow 4 to 5 hours to allow the butter, jam, and lemon to draw into the fish</li>
                <li>Ensure your coals are not too hot as it will burn the fish.(coals should ideally be at a temperature where you can put your hand relatively close, and not feel much burn)</li>
                <li>Cook each side for around 15 to 20 minutes (remember:the snoek cooks inside its own juices inside the foil)</li>
                <li>Before serving, lightly season with some salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Last and most importantly, ENJOY!!!</li>
            </ol>
        
        <p>Now that you have your refreshing and ultra-delicious Snoek, be sure to enjoy it thoroughly, and why crack open a cold one while you're at it!!</p>
