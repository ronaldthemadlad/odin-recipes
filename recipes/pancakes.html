                <li>1 Cup All Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>1/2 Teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>3/4 Teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
                <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
                <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
                <li>3 Tablespoons Melted Butter</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoons Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Essence</li>

            </ul>

        <h3>Method:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Using a large bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, melted butter, sugar and vanilla essence.</li>
                <li>Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into the wet ingredients, and beat thoroughly to combine and form a batter.</li>
                <li>Allow between 30 minutes to 1 hour for the batter to rest to allow the gluten in the batter to rest, although, the pancakes will still be an absolute winner if you don't have the time to spare.</li>
                <li>The consistency of the batter should be akin to that of heavy cream, if your batter is thicker however, you can add a few drops of water at a time and mix until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Once you have heated your pan to a medium to warm heat, throw a dash of oil, or lightly spray with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Use a ladle to pour in the batter, lightly swirl you batter around the pan to coat as much of the surface as you can.</li>
                <li>Cook until small bubbles form on the surface, and then flip to the other side and allow to further cook for another 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
                <li>Remove the pancake and place it open on a plate.</li>
                <li>Add a filling of your choosing, and roll the pancake.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 6-9 until your batter is finished.</li>
                <li>Once your pancakes have been cooked, filled and rolled, they are ready to serve!!</li>
                <li>The final and most important step, ENJOY!!!</li>

            </ol>

            <p>Now that your pancakes have been made, enjoy them with some friends and rock their worlds! Just make sure that you've grabbed at least two or three, because these winners will be <em>"Gone in 60 seconds"!!</em></p>

            <p><strong><em>Serving Suggestion: For fillings, you could use a cinnamon sugar mix, or even Nutella to satisfy that sweet tooth. Chicken Mayo or Mince also make for excellent fillings if you crave something more savoury</em></strong></p>
