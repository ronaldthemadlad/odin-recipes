        <p>Also known as <em>'pannekoek'</em>, it is a South African version of a crepe, and a derivative of the Dutch Pancake. Traditionally served with cinnamon sugar and a small amount of lemon juice. It makes for a great base on which to serve savoury alternatives, since the batter contains little to no sugar. </p>
