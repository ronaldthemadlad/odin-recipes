# odin-recipes

This project is my first website built using HTML. The website itself is a blog-style recipe website and displays the various dishes found in South Africa. 

The index page gives a brief introduction to the website, its contents and its purpose.

The recipes are found through links to separate webpages that have been created, which include the title o the recipe, a picture of the finished product as well as a description of what the recipe is. Below that, is the ingredients and method/s sections containing the basic ingredients needed as well as the method that will be used to achieve a satisfactory end-product.

The skills that I have used in this project in-order to get the most out of the scope given go as follows:

1. I added a basic HTML boilerplate to all of the webpages within the website. This was done to add basic functionality to the webpages, as well as to add structure.

2. Links and Images were used to add visual stimulation by embedding pictures of the finished product for reference as to what the product should look like, as well as to pique interest to encourage anyone that may view the website to read further. I used links to ensure that the recipe webpages as well as their images work seamlessly with my index page. I went a step further and added basic buttons to contain the webpage links in-order to make the website more engaging for potential users, as can be seen in my code.

3. File management was very important in this project, especially with it being my first project. I created my directories and contained my files within them as to make it easier to sort through my webpages and images throughout the during of the project. I created a root directory called 'odin-recipes' and cloned it from my GitHub repository onto my local drive. The root directory for this project was cloned into my 'repos' directory, created for any directories needed for lessons or project that are to be cloned to the local drive. Once I had my root directory on my local drive, I created the 'recipes' and 'images' directories in-order to contain my images that were going to be used on my webpages, as well as the webpages themselves. The index.html, recipe-info.html and README.md files stayed in the root repository as there was no need for them to be contained separately.

4. Git Command-line tools played an important role in the success of the current version of the project. I used functions such as 'Git add', 'git commit -m', and 'git log' to make sure my project stayed up to date as changes, additions as well as subtraction of content was made. 'git log' was particularly helpful when I wanted to double check any changes that were made, especially if I thought I had forgotten, it was confidence inspiring as a developer to know what changes were made when and where, so that I could revert back to a previous version if any bugs ocurred.

5. Although not related to HTML or The Odin Project course, I felt that creativity is what pushed me to make the best content possible for any potential users of my website. I created a blog style website that had many play-on-words type of phrases to best try and connect with the user, and draw them in. I wanted the website to as engaging as possible with the tools I had at hand. I used a descriptive, more casual tone when writing my content and try to put myself in the mind of what I would like to see on a website, from an end-user perspective. Doing so helped me create, what I feel, is an engaging and more personal feeling website that connects with the reader/user in a way that feels less like a script and more like a day to day conversation.



The areas where I struggled at first goes as follows:

1. Upon starting the project, I was extremely excited to be able to put the skills I had learnt throughout the HTML portion of Foundations that I jumped right in and started building my website. However, about halfway through my project, I decided to look at the end product of the top 10 most liked submissions, only to find that my website was somewhat different. I decided to go back and look at the spec sheet given for the project, only to find that I had missed majority of the requirements. I went back to my project and scrapped what I had worked on, other than my index.html webpage. As a result, whilst the project took me slightly longer to complete, I followed the basic guidelines set out by the spec, and ended up with a more coherent, and more satisfying product.

2. Proper file management was something that had ocurred as a result of not properly reading the spec given for the project. Once I had taken the time to read the spec, and followed the basic guidelines, I had no issue managing my directories, and ended with a clean and intuitive file system for the project.

3. In the beginning of the project, I struggled with the git command-line tools as I had not practiced using them enough. Throughout the project however, I began to become more and more comfortable using them, and ended up appreciating the git tools, as they made commits and navigating the directories whilst using VSCode easy.


Throughout this project, I had a few ups and downs, however there was nothing that looking back through the curriculum and using forums, such as Stack OverFlow, could not fix. I learned the importance of reading project requirements before starting a project, as well as how to use git command-line tools to improve my workflow as a developer. Upon using things like links and images within my project, I also learned the importance of proper file management, and how much more enjoyable a project can be when you spend more time being able to code and create engaging content, rather than having to sort through directories in-order to find files.

Overall, I am very happy with the finished product, and cannot wait to be able to implement these new skills that I have learnt along with the languages I will learn as I continue through the curriculum in-order to make stunning, functional, and responsive websites that people want to use and engage with.
