    <h1>Recipes: A Slice Of South African Culture</h1>
        <h5>By Ronald Van As, Tuesday 02/08/2022</h5>

    <p>The year is 2022, <em>Covid-19</em> is "over" and the tourism industry is starting to pick up again. People are starting to consider traveling again, especially as we approach December when companies close down, and school kids get excited for holiday season. You may or may not already have a list of countries you plan on visiting, and if so, why not add South Africa to your list?</p>

        <p>While you're in South Africa, there are probably a few different types of food you should try, to really capture the flavour of South African culture. Do not fret, I will link recipes to the foods I am about to recommend,so can make them back home. You will also find a page with some information and history on the various dishes, so I really do recommend that you check that out too.
