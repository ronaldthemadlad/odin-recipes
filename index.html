    <p>The year is 2022, <em>Covid-19</em> is "over" and the tourism industry is starting to pick up again. People are starting to consider traveling again, especially as we approach December when companies close down, and school kids get excited for holiday season. You may or may not already have a list of countries you plan on visiting, and if so, why not add South Africa to your list?</p>
